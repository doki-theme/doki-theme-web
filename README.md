</div>

So I thought it was a good idea to add a bit of culture to this plugin.
<sup><sup>Ya boi is horny on main.</sup></sup>

I will give you a bit of a warning before you install suggestive content.
Some of us are professional Otaku, who want to remain, well...professional.
Don't worry if you choose to continue, I won't ask you again for that specific theme.

Applies for the following content:

- Rias Onyx: Secondary Content


Due to limitations of the platform(s), the Doki Theme has been broken into 2 pieces.

### Theme

Chromium based browsers only allows modifications to the look and feel of the browser when the extension is a theme.
You can find installable versions of these extensions in the `chromeThemes`|`edgeThemes` directory of the repository.

### Master Extension

If you would like even more Doki-Theme in your web-browsing experience then this plugin is for you.
This will modify the CSS of every webpage that you visit with CSS that is themed to your current waifu.

Things that are currently changed:

- Selection foreground/background
- Scrollbars
