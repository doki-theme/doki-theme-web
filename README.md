# Feature Set

Because Chrome & Edge are jerks, I need to provide 2 extensions: 
  - One to theme your browser
  - One to modify the contents of your active tab & Theme your New tab.

**Theme Extension**

This makes your browser look and feel like it is part of the Doki Theme.

**New Tab Extension**

This extension overrides your New Tab, and replaces it with a tab whose background has the official Doki Theme asset.
It also can inject styles into ever tab to theme the: Scroll Bar & Selection text, to match your selected theme.

### Configuration

You can configure the extension by opening the popup menu & clicking:
- The Doki Theme logo located at the top.
